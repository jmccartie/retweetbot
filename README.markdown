= RetweetBot

RetweetBot listens for certain keywords or hashtags and native retweets what it hears. It uses the Twitter streaming APIs and runs inside an EventMachine reactor. If Twitter is functioning properly, discovering matching tweets is near instant.

== Requirements

You will need to register an application at https://dev.twitter.com/apps to get the required oAuth credentials. These are used to make the retweets. Retweetbot also requires you give it a username and password. This is used to use Twitter's streaming API. Unfortunately, the streaming API does not support oAuth at this time.

== Installation

Copy config.template.json to config.json, open it in your favorite editor and fill out the values required.

The filter array may contain either hashtags or keywords.

== License

RetweetBot is released under the MIT license.
